# SkinSplitter
Splits your Bitmap into a bunch of skins which you can upload and then cache on NameMC for a nice pixel art

## Usage

1) Run main.py
2) Load `input_example.png` or any other file that is 72x24 in size
3) Upload resulting skins starting from skin_01.png, ending with skin_26.png or skin_27.png (depending on how you want to make it look on your profile) on Minecraft.net. If you want to, you can ignore the last `skin_27.png` file and upload your original skin instead.
4) For each upload, open [NameMC profile link](https://namemc.com/profile/KolyaBybit.1) to sync the skin
5) ... profit! You can use the link above to take a look at how it'll look like on a profile.
